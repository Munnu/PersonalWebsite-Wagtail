        'I don't know what you mean,' said Alice.
        'Of course you don't!' the Hatter said, tossing his head contemptuously. 'I dare say you never even spoke to Time!'
        'Perhaps not,' Alice cautiously replied: 'but I know I have to beat time when I learn music.'
        'Ah! that accounts for it,' said the Hatter. 'He won't stand beating. Now, if you only kept on good terms with him, he'd do almost anything you liked with the clock.

Half-past one, time for dinner!'
